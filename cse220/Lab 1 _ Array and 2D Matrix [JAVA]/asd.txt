Scott MacMillan’s (2022) "Hope over Fate" illustrates the life-changing journey of Shahida Begum,a poor widow woman from northern Bangladesh, through BRAC’s innovative program.Firstly, The author builds Shahida’s initial existence in the Brahmaputra River’s chars,which is a fragile, floodprone region.After that,MacMillan (2022) narrates her early life where she endured child marriage, widowhood, and grueling brickfield labor, a life without any hope.Then,MacMillan (2022) exemplifies the revolutionary intervention by BRAC in 2002 enabling her to make assets and develop deep emotional bonds with her livestock. Moveoever,MacMillan (2022) eventually demonstrates her incredible progress by 2019 from a laborer to self independent,showing this change not just to material inputs but to a psychological outcome(MacMillan, 2022). Ultimately, MacMillan (2022) frames this as part of BRAC founder Fazle Hasan Abed’s vision, arguing that well-structured support can replace the despair with hope by addressing both economic deprivation and psychological hopelessness .
